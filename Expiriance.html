    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> Life is a journey of tenacity. Only the tough gets to the top through the storm. Take the steps one by one though the errand may be arduous. Never give up though you may grow weary. Think of the purpose though its attainment may be tough. Dare to get to the crown though you may meet the obstacles. You are never born to relax all day but to dare to do the undone. If only it is reasonable enough within the real reasons of your life, and if your soul and spirit convince you of getting it done, then, you have the real reasons to dare for the crown. </p>
    <p>Your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer</p>
